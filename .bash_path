# This provides `diff-highlight` which is used in ~/.gitconfig.
# `diff-highlight` is distributed with even some pre-2.0 versions of Git, so
# you almost definitely already have it! It can just be hard to find and use.
#
# IMPORTANT: This path may not work on your system!!! I found it on
# a 2022 Debian-based distro with: `dpkg -L git | grep diff-highlight`
#     https://stackoverflow.com/a/55891251
#
# IMPORTANT: The software may not be "built" in this path!!! If you see
# `diff-highlight.perl`, but not an executable `diff-highlight` script, you may
# need to `sudo make` within $DIFFHIGHLIGHT_PATH. If you do see
# `diff-highlight` script, but it's not executable, you may need to `chmod +x
# $DIFFHIGHLIGHT_PATH/diff-highlight`.
